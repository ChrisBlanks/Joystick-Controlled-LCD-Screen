# Joystick-Controlled-LCD-Screen
A joystick module is used to perform functions on a 16x2 LCD screen.

The first implementation of this project dealt with outputing ASCII
characters onto the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen. The joystick
module uses potentiometers and a push button. The X-axis potentiometer
was used to control the cursor on the LCD screen. The Y-axis potentiometer
was used to increment or decrement through the ASCII character values. The
push button in the joystick was used to clear the screen and reset the cursor
position.
